    <h1>Refund & Cancellation Policy</h1>
    <p>Last updated: February 2026</p>
    
    <p>At <strong>Air Type</strong>, we offer a 1-Day Free Trial to ensure that our remote typing service meets your needs before you make a purchase.</p>

    <h3>1. Cancellations</h3>
    <p>Since our service is based on digital subscriptions, you can stop using the service at any time. There is no formal cancellation required for the free trial period.</p>

    <h3>2. Refunds</h3>
    <p>Due to the nature of digital software and immediate access to premium features, we generally do not offer refunds once a pro subscription is purchased. However, customer satisfaction is important to us.</p>
    
    <p>If you experience technical issues where the app fails to perform its core function, please contact us at <strong>remoteairtypeapp@gmail.com</strong> within 48 hours of your purchase. We will investigate the issue and, if it cannot be resolved, we will process a refund.</p>

    <h3>3. Process</h3>
    <p>Approved refunds will be processed within <strong>5-7 business days</strong> and will be credited back to the original payment method used via Razorpay.</p>
